
Self-Reflection:

This assignment has a lot to learn about C# and logics. 
I am thankful for that. 
Since I forget to mention self-reflection in the Canvasâ€™s comment section. 
Therefore, mentioning here:

1) Firstly, I learned lot more about arrays and matrix related logic and problem.
On the way to solve problems, I overcome various logical operations and
this assignment was very helpful to understand that.

2) Upgraded my skills on the logical part through loops and conditions.

3) Lastly using GitHub was exciting.

Thank you!
